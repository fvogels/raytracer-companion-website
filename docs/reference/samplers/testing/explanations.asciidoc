= Testing

When creating a sampler extension, you will often be asked to write tests.
Some students have trouble understanding the notation used to describe rectangles.
This page explains how to interpret it.

Say we assigment mentions the rectangle

[stem]
++++
[0, 1] \times [2, 4]
++++

The first interval stem:[[0,1\]] denotes the range over which the rectangle extends in the X-dimension:

image::examplex.png[align="center",width="25%"]

Similary, the second interval stem:[[2,4\]], denotes the range in the Y-dimension:

image::exampley.png[align="center",width="25%"]

Taking the intersection of both areas gives us the rectangle we are looking for:

image::examplexy.png[align="center",width="25%"]

Now we need to represent this rectangle using the `Rectangle2D` class.
Its constructor takes three parameters:

* An `Point2D` origin, which must represent one of the corners of the rectangle.
* An `Vector2D` X axis, which must represent one side of the rectangle.
* An `Vector2D` Y axis, which must represent the other size of the rectangle.

There are multiple ways to define a single rectangle (e.g., we have 4 possible origins as the rectangle has 4 corners).
One way is shown in the figure below:

image::example.png[align="center",width="25%"]

The corresponding {cpp} is

[source,language='c++']
----
Rectangle2D rectangle(Point2D(0, 2), Vector2D(1, 0), Vector2D(0, 2));
