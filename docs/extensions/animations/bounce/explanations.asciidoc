== Implementation

The bounce animation looks as follows:

image::graph.png[align="center"]

The animation can be parameterized in two ways:

* Number of bounces
+
image::bounces.png[align="center"]
* Bounce absorption
+
image::absorption.png[align="center"]

[TASK]
====
Create files `math/functions/easing/bounce-easing-function.cpp/.h`.
Use `linear-easing-function.h/.cpp` as a guide.
You'll need to find the formula yourself.

Don't forget to add a binding for the scripting language.
In `scripting/math-module`, update the `EasingLibrary` structure and add an extra `BIND` to `add_easing`.
