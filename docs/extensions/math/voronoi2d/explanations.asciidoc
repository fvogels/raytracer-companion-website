== Explanation

[TASK]
====
Implement a class ``Voronoi2D`` that provides the following functionality.

* The constructor should receive a seed (or something functionally equivalent) making it possible to generate the exact same Voronoi diagram deterministically.
* A member function ``closest_to``, that, given a ``Point2D``, returns the ``Point2D`` closest to it.

The class should not restrict itself to a particular part of the plane.
Instead, it should fill the entire (infinite) plane with an infinite number of points, thereby creating an infinitely large Voronoi diagram.
