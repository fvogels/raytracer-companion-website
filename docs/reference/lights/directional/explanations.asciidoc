= Directional Lights

== Explanation

Directional light is the same as an omnidirectional point light, except that its position is infinitely far away.
For example, the sun can be seen as directional light.

Typical for directional lights is the fact that shadows are parallel. In the animation above,
a directional light and an omnidirectional light are combined in the same scene. The shadows
that are perfectly aligned to each other are cast by the directional light.
