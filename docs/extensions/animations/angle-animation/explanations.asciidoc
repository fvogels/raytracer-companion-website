= Angle Animation

[overview]
----
excludes animations/point-animation
----

== Implementation

By default, the scripting language in your ray tracer only supports `double` animations.
For this extension, you will add support for `Angle`animations.

[source,language="chai"]
----
// Old way
var x = Animations.animate(0, 360, seconds(1))
var alpha = degrees(x[now])

// New way
var alpha = Animations.animate( degrees(0), degrees(360), seconds(1) )
----

[TASK]
====
Find a way to add support for `Angle` animations.
If you find out how `double` animations work, it is truly trivial to adapt it to ``Angle``s.
