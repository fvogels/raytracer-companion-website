= Half-Jittered Sampler

== Definition

A half-jittering sampler takes two parameters stem:[N] and stem:[M]. Given a rectangle to be sampled,
it subdivides this rectangle into stem:[N \times M] subrectangles of equal size.
The sampler then returns a random point close to the center of each subrectangle, to make sure samples
cannot be too close to each other.
