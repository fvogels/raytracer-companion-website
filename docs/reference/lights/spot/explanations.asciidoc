= Spot Lights

== Explanation

Contrary to omnidirectional lights, which send photons out in all directions, spot lights
emit photons as if blocked by a cone:

A spot light has the following characteristics:

* A position stem:[L].
* A central shining direction specified by a vector stem:[\vec v] (shown in red in the above figure).
* A beam angle stem:[\theta].

The spot light sends lights to some location stem:[P] if the angle between stem:[LP] and stem:[\vec v] is less than stem:[\frac\theta2].
We know the dot product stem:[\vec u \cdot \vec v] gives us the cosine of the angle between the two vectors stem:[\vec u] and stem:[\vec v].
Given that the cosine decreases with increasing angle, we get

\alpha < \beta \Leftrightarrow \cos\alpha > \cos\beta \qquad \textrm{for } 0 \leq \alpha, \beta \leq 90^\circ

Applied to our spot lights, this results in

\frac{P-L}{|P-L|} \cdot \vec v \geq \cos \frac\theta2
