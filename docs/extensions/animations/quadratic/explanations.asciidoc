== Implementation

[TASK]
====
Create files ``math/functions/easing/quadratic-function.cpp/.h`` and implement ``quadratic_in``, ``quadratic_out`` and ``quadratic_inout``.
Use ``linear-easing-function.h/.cpp`` as a guide.
You'll need to find the formulae yourself.

Don't forget to add a binding for the scripting language.
In ``scripting/math-module``, update the ``EasingLibrary`` structure and add an extra ``BIND`` to ``add_easing``.
