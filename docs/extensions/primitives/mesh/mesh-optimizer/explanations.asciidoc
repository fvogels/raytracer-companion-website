== Implementation

For this extension, you will have to optimize a mesh.
More concretely, given a file containing an unoptimized mesh (i.e., a mesh with all its triangles in a single box) and will have to create a bounding box hierarchy and store the results in a new file.

[TASK]
====
Create a tool that builds bounding box hierarchies for meshes.
You can implement it in any language you want.

== Evaluation

[TASK]
