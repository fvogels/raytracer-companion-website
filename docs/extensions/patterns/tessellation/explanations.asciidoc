= Tessellation

[overview]
----
difficulty 3
requires patterns/basics
----

As mentioned before, a pattern can be seen as a black and white image.
But not just any black and white image, but rather an infinitely large one.
For any position stem:[(x, y)] or stem:[(x, y, z)], the pattern must decide whether that spot is black or white.

In order to fill up this infinite space, we generally rely on repetition: one simple patterns gets copied an infinite number of times.
In this extension, you will have to create the "for loop" of patterns: the `tessellate` operation takes a pattern, a width and a height and will then copy this ad infinitum.

[EXAMPLE]
====
We start off we with simple pattern:

image::single.png[align="center",width="25%"]

Tessellation will lead to this:

image::tessellation.png[align="center",width="25%"]

== Implementation

[TASK]
====
Create files `patterns/pattern-tessellation.cpp` and `patterns/pattern-tessellation.h`.

Also add the header file to `patterns/patterns.h`.
====

=== tessellate

[TASK]
====
Implement tessellation as a function

[source,language='c++']
----
Pattern2D tessellate(Pattern2D pattern, double width, double height)

You can avoid having to define an entire class if you rely on <</extensions/patterns/lambda/explanations#,make_pattern>>.

=== tessellate_x, tessellate_y

`tessellation` takes a rectangular pattern and copies it both horizontally and vertically.
What if we already have an infinitely wide pattern and only need to copy it vertically, or vice versa?

[TASK]
====
Implement horizontal and vertical tessellation as two functions

[source,language='c++']
----
Pattern2D tessellate_x(Pattern2D pattern, double width)
Pattern2D tessellate_y(Pattern2D pattern, double height)

=== tessellate in 3D

The same trick can be applied in 3D.
We get a "pattern box" which is copied along all three axes.

[TASK]
====
Implement 3D tessellation as

[source,language='c++']
----
Pattern3D tessellate(Pattern3D pattern,
                     double x_size,
                     double y_size,
                     double z_size)

=== Finishing Touches

[TASK]
====
Add bindings to expose this new functionality to the scripting language.

== Evaluation
