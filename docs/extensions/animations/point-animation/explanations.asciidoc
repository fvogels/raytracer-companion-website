= Point Animation

== Implementation

By default, the scripting language in your ray tracer only supports ``double`` animations.
For this extension, you will add support for ``Point3D`` animations.

[source,language="chai"]
----
// Old way
var x = Animations.animate(0, 4, seconds(1))
var y = Animations.animate(5, 1, seconds(1))
var z = Animations.animate(3, 4, seconds(1))
var p = pos(x[now], y[now], z[now])

// New way
var p = Animations.animate(pos(0,5,3), pos(4,1,4), seconds(1))

[TASK]
====
Find a way to add support for ``Point3D`` animations.
If you find out how ``double`` animations work, it should be trivial to adapt it to ``Point3D``s.
