== Implementation

For this extension, you will implement three cones:

* One that is directed along the X-axis.
* One that is directed along the Y-axis.
* One that is directed along the Z-axis.

All three are infinitely long, make an angle of 45&deg; and go through stem:[(0, 0, 0)].

[TASK]
====
* Create new files `primitives/cone-primitive.cpp` and `primitives/cone-primitive.h`.
* Write the necessary class(es) that model these three cylinders.
* Provide factory functions `cone_along_x()`, `cone_along_y()`, `cone_along_z()`.
* Add bindings so as to make cones available in the scripting language.
====

[TIP]
=====
You are given a class `QuadraticEquation` which can come in handy.
=====

[TIP]
====
You can start off with copying the `Sphere` primitive code and change the code so that it models a cylinder.
