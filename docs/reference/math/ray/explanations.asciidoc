= Rays

A _ray_ consists of two components:

* an origin stem:[O] of type ``Point3D``;
* a direction stem:[\vec\Delta] of type ``Vector3D``.

The ray is the entirety of points that lies on the line that goes through stem:[O] and has orientation stem:[\vec\Delta].
All points on the ray are represented by the thin red line on the above figure.

Mathematically, a ray is written as follows:

[stem]
++++
  O + \vec\Delta \cdot t
++++

where stem:[t \in \mathbb{R}].

Each point on the ray has a unique stem:[t]-value associated with it. stem:[t] represents the number of "steps" of size stem:[\Delta] one
has to make starting at the origin stem:[O]. For example,

* stem:[t = 0]: take zero steps starting in the origin stem:[O]. You obviously end up in stem:[O].
* stem:[t = 1]: take one step away from stem:[O] in direction stem:[\vec\Delta].
* stem:[t = 5]: take five steps away from stem:[O] in direction stem:[\vec\Delta].
* stem:[t = -1]: take one step in the _opposite_ direction of stem:[\vec\Delta].

In the ray tracer, the ray's origin will often coincide with the eye.
If stem:[t > 0], the point is in front of the eye; if stem:[t < 0], the point is behind the eye.
Making this distinction is very important in ray tracing: you will only be interested
in points in front of the eye.
