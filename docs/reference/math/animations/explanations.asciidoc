== The Quintessential Animation

An animation is "something" that changes in time. This something can be a simple ``double``,
an ``Angle``, a ``Point3D``, &hellip;

Let us consider the most basic of animations: the ``double`` animation that
goes from ``0`` to ``1`` in ``1`` second.
If we are to visualize this, we would get:

The animation is actually a <em>function</em> mapping time values to ``double`` values.
Let's denote this function with $X(t)$. We can translate the properties above to mathematical formulae:
in the very beginning, the animated ``double`` should have value $0$. This is expressed by
\[
X(0) = 0
\]
Next, we know the animation takes 1 second to finish and that the ``double``
should have value $1$ at that time:
\[
X(1) = 1
\]

Now, there are many ways in which we could want to modify this animation.
For example, we assumed that the ``double`` moves "in a straight line" from ``0`` to ``1``.
Other possibilities would be

We may also want to change the starting and ending value of the animation, e.g. have a ``double`` go
from ``10`` to ``20``. The duration is also an aspect we may wish to modify.

While we could bundle all parameters together into one 'superanimation', we prefer to keep things modular.

== Formula for the Basic Animation

Before modifying the basic animation, let's first focus on the mathematical formula behind it.

We know the animation goes in a straight line, meaning $X(t)$ has the form $m \cdot t + q$ where
$m$ and $q$ can be deduced from the constraints $X(0) = 0$ and $X(1) = 1$. We get
\[
X(t) = t
\]
which is a pretty simple formula.

== Changing the Range

Say we don't want to animate from ``0`` to ``1``, but from
``10`` to ``20``, or better, from $a$ to $b$. We can achieve this
easily by mapping the interval $[0, 1]$ to $[a, b]$.

We build another function, $f$, that can do this for us. Again this is linear function:
\[
f(x) = m \cdot x + q \qquad f(0) = a \qquad f(1) = b
\]
which gives
\[
f(x) = a + (b - a) \cdot x
\]

How can we combine this function $f$ with the basic animation $X(t)$ to produce
an animation from $a$ to $b$? Simple: we first animate $0$ to $1$ and
use $f$ to map the value to $[a, b]$. Let's call this new animation $X_2(t)$.
\[
X_2(t) = f(X(t)) = f \circ X
\]

== Changing the Domain

The basic animation takes one second to complete. What if we want a shorter or longer animation?

Say we want the animation to take $\tau$ seconds. Our time will then vary from $0$ to $\tau$, whereas
the basic animation expects it to vary from $0$ to $1$. We somehow need to translate "our time" to the "basic animation's time".
Again we can do this with a linear transformation:

<%= tex_image 'domain-mapping' %>

Let's assign the name $g$ to the function that maps the interval $[0, \tau]$ to $[0,1]$.
\[
g(t) = \frac{t}{\tau}
\]

Given our basic animation $X(t)$, which moves from $0$ to $1$ in 1 second,
we can transform it to an animation $X_3(t)$ that goes from $0$ to $1$ in $\tau$ seconds as follows:
\[
X_3(t) = X(g(t)) = X \circ g
\]

== Changing the Shape

The basic animation is linear: it moves from $0$ to $1$ at constant speed. However,
if we were to chain animations, the transition from one animation to the next
would be perceived as very abrupt. Compare the animations below:

Animations can be made smoother using <em>easing functions</em>. Below are a few examples:

[cols="^,^,^"]
|===
| image:quad-in.png[]
| image:quad-out.png[]
| image:bounce.png[]
|===

An easing function $e(x)$ is a function for which

\[
e(0) = 0 \qquad e(1) = 1
\]

How it moves from $0$ to $1$ is up to the easing function.

If we want to apply some easing function $e(x)$ to the basic animation $X(t)$ yielding the new animation $X_3(t)$, we use the following formula:

\[
X_3(t) = X(e(t)) = X \circ e
\]

== Putting It All Together

Using the range mapper $f$, the domain mapper $g$ and the easing function $e$ we can transform the basic animation any way we want:
\[
f(X(g(e(t)))) = f \circ X \circ g \circ e
\]

We can build a library of range mappers, domain mappers and easing functions and use them to produce any animation we want.

== Building Animations

The ``double`` animation is the basic building block for all animations: all other animations can be built from it.
Let's introduce a convenient notation to denote ``double`` animations:
\[
X(t) = x \xrightarrow{\tau} y
\]
represents a ``double`` animation from $x$ to $y$ in $\tau$ seconds. We ignore the shape of the animation for now, i.e.
we disregard easing functions.

Say we now want to create ``Point3D`` animation $P(t)$: we wish a movement
from $(0, 0, 10)$ to $(0, 5, 0)$. The animation of a ``Point3D``
is the animation of its components, i.e. its x, y and z-coordinates:
\[
  (0, 0, 10) \xrightarrow{\tau} (0,5,0) \quad=\quad (0 \xrightarrow{\tau} 0, 0 \xrightarrow{\tau} 5, 10 \xrightarrow{\tau} 0)
\]
or, more generally,
\[
  (x, y, z) \xrightarrow{\tau} (x',y',z') \quad=\quad (x \xrightarrow{\tau} x', y \xrightarrow{\tau} y', z \xrightarrow{\tau} z')
\]
We can animate colors or any other type of value the same way:
\[
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    (r, g, b) \xrightarrow{\tau} (r', g', b') & = & (r \xrightarrow{\tau} r', g \xrightarrow{\tau} g', b \xrightarrow{\tau} b') \\ \\
    50^\circ \xrightarrow{\tau} 100^\circ & = & (50 \xrightarrow{\tau} 100)^\circ
   \end{array}
\]
