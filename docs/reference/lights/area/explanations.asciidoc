= Area Lights

== Explanation

A point light is a zero-dimensional entity: it has no size. All photons emitted by such a light source
originate in the same point. When determining which photons reach some location $P$,
either all photons from a point light reach $P$, or none of them do. This has as consequence that
shadows are very sharp.

Area lights are mathematically an infinite set of point lights arranged in a rectangular area.
This leads to soft shadows:
