= Complex Numbers

== Context

As a reminder, these are the common number sets:

[stem]
++++
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    \mathbb{N} & = & \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots \} \\
    \mathbb{Z} & = & \mathbb{N} \; \bigcup \; \{ -1, -2, -3, -4, \dots \} \\
    \mathbb{Q} & = & \mathbb{Z} \; \bigcup \; \{ \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, -\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, -\frac{2}{3}, \dots \} \\
    \mathbb{R} & = & \mathbb{Q} \; \bigcup \; \{ \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \pi, \dots \} \\
  \end{array}

=== History of Numbers

First there was set set of natural numbers stem:[\mathbb{N}]. Addition never posed a problem, but subtraction stem:[a - b]
was only possible if stem:[a \geq b].

To make subtraction stem:[a - b] possible where stem:[a < b], such as stem:[3 - 5], negative numbers were invented (stem:[\mathbb{Z}]).
All was good, until someone noticed that division wasn't always possible: while stem:[8 / 2] was perfectly defined,
what is stem:[8 / 3] equal to?

Rational numbers solve this division problem by introducing rational numbers (stem:[\mathbb{Q}]). Then someone came along
pointing out that stem:[\sqrt{2}] could not be written as a fraction. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number[According to legend],
this person was prompty thrown out to sea for his efforts.

The real numbers (stem:[\mathbb{R}]) were then defined so as to make it possible to take the root of any number. Any positive number, that is.


=== Imaginary Numbers

Mathematicians have a tendency to be quite the rebels. Whenever someone tells them something is impossible,
they promptly set out to axiomatically state that the answer exists. In our case, while everyone tells
you stem:[\sqrt{-1}] is not possible, some mathematician stated the opposite: the square root of stem:[-1] _does_
exist and it has a name: stem:[i], short for _imaginary unit_.


== Definition

The imaginary unit stem:[i] is defined as
[stem]
++++
  i = \sqrt{-1}
++++

A complex number has the form
[stem]
++++
  a + b \cdot i
++++
where stem:[a, b \in \mathbb{R}]. The set of complex numbers is called stem:[\mathbb{C}].

When working with complex numbers, you simply have to treat stem:[i] as if it were some unknown value of which you know
that stem:[i^2 = -1].

== Interpretation

While real numbers form a _totally ordered set_, which means that for
any two real numbers stem:[x] and stem:[y], either stem:[x < y], stem:[x > y] or stem:[x = y] must be true.
This has as consequence that real numbers can be laid out on a line:
take a line, pick a point to represent stem:[0], and all other numbers must then be placed
according to the rule "if stem:[x < y] then stem:[x] must be placed to the left of stem:[y]".

Complex numbers do not fit on a single line as they are inherently 2 dimensional.
Instead, we speak of the complex _plane_.

The complex number stem:[a + b \cdot i]'s position can be found as follows: interpret stem:[a]
and stem:[b] as the stem:[x] and stem:[y] coordinates. The result looks like this:

== Operations on Complex Numbers

Most standard operations are defined on complex numbers:

[stem]
++++
  (a_1 + b_1 \cdot i) + (a_2 + b_2 \cdot i) = (a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2) \cdot i
++++

[stem]
++++
  (a_1 + b_1 \cdot i) - (a_2 + b_2 \cdot i) = (a_1 - a_2) + (b_1 - b_2) \cdot i
++++

Multiplication consists of applying distributivity and simplifying stem:[i^2] to stem:[-1]:

[stem]
++++
  (a_1 + b_1 i) \cdot (a_2 + b_2i) = a_1a_2 + a_1b_2i+a_2b_1i+b_1b_2i^2 = (a_1 a_2 - b_1 b_2) + (a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1) \cdot i
++++

The absolute value of a complex number is its distance from stem:[0]:

[stem]
++++
  |a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
++++

== Visual Interpretation of Multiplication

Multiplication of complex numbers coincides with rotation in 2D.
Say you have a point stem:[(x, y)] that you want to rotate by an angle stem:[\theta] around the origin, you can find it using

[stem]
++++
  x' + y' i = (x + y i) \cdot (\cos(\theta) + \sin(\theta) i) = (x \cos(\theta) - y \sin(\theta)) + (x \sin(\theta)+y \cos(\theta)) i
++++

which yields the same result as when using rotation matrices:

[stem]
++++
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
    \sin\theta & \cos\theta
  \end{bmatrix}
  \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x \cos(\theta) - y \sin(\theta) \\
    x \sin(\theta)+y \cos(\theta)
  \end{bmatrix}
++++
