== Implementation

Start by implementing squares.
Then you can combine six squares to form a single cube.

[TASK]
====
Implement the square primitive.

* Make three variants: `xy_square`, `xz_square` and `yz_square`.
* Make canonical squares:
** The squares should have its center at stem:[(0, 0, 0)].
** The squares should have side 2.
====

[TASK]
====
Implement a cube primitive.

* The cube should have dimensions 2 &times; 2 &times; 2.
* The cube should be centered around stem:[(0, 0, 0)].
