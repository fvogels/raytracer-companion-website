== Implementation

[TASK]
====
Create files `math/functions/easing/cubic-function.cpp/.h` and implement
`cubic_in`, `cubic_out` and `cubic_inout`.
Use `linear-easing-function.h/.cpp` as a guide. You'll need to find the formulae yourself.

Don't forget to add a binding for the scripting language. In `scripting/math-module`, update the `EasingLibrary` structure and add an extra `BIND` to `add_easing`.
