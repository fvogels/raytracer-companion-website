== Elastic

You'll need to find the formula for bouncing yourself.
Rely on a graphing software such as https://www.desmos.com/calculator[Desmos's graphing calculator].

[TASK]
====
* Start by making a graph of stem:[\cos(x)].
+

* stem:[\cos(x)] swings around stem:[0] going back and forth between stem:[-1] and stem:[1].
  We need it to swing between stem:[0] and stem:[2] instead.
+

* It starts at 2 and goes down to 0.
  We need it to start at 0 and go up to 2.
  Modify the formula so that we get

* Try to increase the frequency. Add some number in the formule, e.g., stem:[F \cos(x)] or stem:[\cos(F x)] where stem:[F] is some number representing the frequency.
+

* Find a way to make the bumps become smaller as time passes by.
  You will need to divide the stem:[\cos] by an expression that involves stem:[x].
  Be careful that you divide by numbers greater than 1, otherwise your animation will swing outside the stem:[[0, 2\]] interval.

=== Implementation

[TASK]
====
Create files `math/functions/easing/elastic-easing-function.cpp/.h`.
Use `linear-easing-function.h/.cpp` as a guide.

Don't forget to add a binding for the scripting language.
In `scripting/math-module`, update the `EasingLibrary` structure and add an extra `BIND` to `add_easing`.

== Bouncy

=== Formula

Here too you will need to find the mathematical formula that describes a bouncy animation.

[TIP]
====
* Start off with stem:[\cos(x)].
+
image::bouncy1.png[align="center",width="50%"]
* The function goes below the X-axis.
  You'll need to add something so that it remains positive.
+

* Once you have found the trick to make the stem:[\cos] bounce, you can apply it to your elastic formula.
