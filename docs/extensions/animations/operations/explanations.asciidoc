== Introduction

Numbers have operations defined on them: we can add two numbers together (stem:[a + b]), subtract them (stem:[a - b]), multiply them (stem:[a \times b]), and so on.
Similary, we can apply operations on primitives: take their union, their difference, their intersection, we can translate, scale and rotate them, and so on.
The same can be done with animations.

In this extension, you are tasked with defines a series of operations that act upon animations.

== Invert

An animation can be _inverted_: instead of going from A to B, it goes from B to A.

image::invert.png[align="center",width="50%"]

[TASK]
====
Create a file `animation/animation-inverter.h`.
In the namespace `animation`, create a function

[source,language="c++"]
----
template<typename T>
Animation<T> invert(Animation<T> animation)
{
  ...
}
----

that returns the inversion of the given animation
====

[TIP]
====
First examine `animations/interval-animation.h` and try to understand what each part does.
`invert` will have the same structure.
====

== Sequence

Animations can be put in sequence.
For example, consider the two animations below, each lasting 10 seconds:

image::sequence.png[align="center",width="50%"]

Sequencing them yields

image::sequence2.png[align="center",width="50%"]

Typically, you will only combine animations if they have matching endpoints (ending point of the first is equal to the starting point of the second), but this is not mandatory.

[TASK]
====
Create a file `animation/animation-sequence.h`.
In the namespace `animation`, create a function

[source,language="c++"]
----
template<typename T>
Animation<T> sequence(Animation<T> a, Animation<T> b)
{
  ...
}
----

== Looper

An animation can be repeated at infinitum.
For example, take the animation below:

image::looper.png[align="center",width="50%"]

Repeating this animation endlessly gives a new animation with infinite duration:

image::looper2.png[align="center",width="50%"]

[TASK]
====
Create a file `animation/animation-looper.h`.
In the namespace `animation`, create a function

[source,language="c++"]
----
template<typename T>
Animation<T> loop(Animation<T> a)
{
  ...
}
----

== Cyclic

== Limit
