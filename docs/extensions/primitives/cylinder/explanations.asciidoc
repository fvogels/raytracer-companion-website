== Implementation

For this extension, you will implement three cylinders:

* One that is directed along the X-axis.
* One that is directed along the Y-axis.
* One that is directed along the Z-axis.

All three are infinitely long, have a radius of 1 and go through stem:[(0, 0, 0)].


[TASK]
====
* Create new files `primitives/cylinder-primitive.cpp` and `primitives/cylinder-primitive.h`.
* Write the necessary class(es) that model these three cylinders.
* Provide factory functions `cylinder_along_x()`, `cylinder_along_y()`, `cylinder_along_z()`.
* Add bindings so as to make cylinders available in the scripting language.

[TIP]
====
You can start off with copying the `Sphere` primitive code and change the code so that it models a cylinder.
