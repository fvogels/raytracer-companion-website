= 3D Cartesian Coordinate System

In a 3D Cartesian coordinate system is defined by its origin point stem:[O] and three perpendicular axes stem:[X], stem:[Y] and stem:[Z].
The location of each point in 3D space can be expressed using coordinates stem:[(x, y, z)].

== Left vs Right Handed

We distinguish two kinds of 3D Cartesian coordinate system: left handed and right handed ones.
These differ in the orientation of the Z-axis with respect to the stem:[X] and stem:[Y]-axis.

The distinction between both becomes apparent when dealing with the <</reference/math/cross-product/explanations#,cross product>>.
During this course, we will always use the right handed variant.
