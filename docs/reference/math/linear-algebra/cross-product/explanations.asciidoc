= Cross Product

Contrary to the <</reference/math/linear-algebra/dot-product/explanations#,dot product>> which
resulted in a scalar, the cross product yields a _vector_, which can be found using the following formula:

[stem]
++++
  (x_1, y_1, z_1) \times (x_2, y_2, z_2) = (y_1 \cdot z_2-y_2 \cdot z_1, x_2 \cdot z_1-x_1 \cdot z_2, x_1 \cdot y_2 - x_2 \cdot y_1)
++++

The resulting vector has the following characteristics:

* stem:[\vec u \times \vec v] is perpendicular to both stem:[\vec u] and stem:[\vec v].
* The length of the resulting vector equals the product of the lengths of the operands times the sine of the angle they form.

[stem]
++++
|\vec u \times \vec v| = |\vec u| \cdot |\vec v| \cdot \sin(\theta)
++++
* Be careful: the cross product is _not_ commutative: stem:[\vec u \times \vec v \neq \vec v \times \vec u]. We will expand upon this shortly.

In this course, we will mostly rely on the first property: being able to find a vector that is perpendicular to two others
will regularly come in handy.

There is one catch, though. Given two (nonparallel) vectors, there are always _two_ vectors perpendicular to both.
If some vector stem:[\vec p] is perpendicular to both stem:[\vec u] and stem:[\vec v], then so is stem:[-\vec{p}].

One perpendicular vector will be given by stem:[\vec u \times \vec v], the other by stem:[\vec v \times \vec u].
It is very important to know which product yields which vector. This
<</reference/math/coordinate-systems/cartesian3d/explanations#,depends on the coordinate system used>>.

Say we position ourselves in front of the XY-axes so that X points right and Y points upwards.
Then there are two possible choices for Z: either Z points away from us, or it comes towards us.
If it points away, it is called a left-hand coordinate system, otherwise a right-hand coordinate system.
The reasoning behind this naming goes as follows: let your thumb point in X-direction
and your index in the Y-direction.
Depending on which hand you used, your middle finger will then, if extended,
either point towards you or away from you. This determines the Z-direction.

The cross product obeys the same rule: to find out which way stem:[\vec u \times \vec v] points,
align your thumb with stem:[\vec u] and your index finger with stem:[\vec v]. Your middle finger then points in the same direction as stem:[\vec{u} \times \vec{v}].

During this course, we will make use of right hand systems exclusively.
