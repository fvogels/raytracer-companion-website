= Elastic Easing Function

== Visualization

video::elastic.mp4[align="center"]

The elastic easing function's graph looks like this:

The fact that it starts at 0 and bounces against the 1-ceiling might seem unintuitive to you, but don't forget that the _starting position_ corresponds to 0 and the _ending position_ to 1.

== Parameters

The animation can be parameterized in two ways:

* Number of bounces
+

* Bounce absorption
+
