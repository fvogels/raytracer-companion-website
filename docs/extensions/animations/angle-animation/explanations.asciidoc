= Angle Animation

[overview]
----
excludes animations/point-animation
----

== Implementation

By default, the scripting language in your ray tracer only supports `double` animations.
For this extension, you will add support for `Angle`animations.

[source,chai]

[TASK]
====
Find a way to add support for `Angle` animations.
If you find out how `double` animations work, it is truly trivial to adapt it to ``Angle``s.
