[TASK]
====
Use ``MaterialTransformer3D`` to implement 3D material rotation around the X, Y and Z axis.
In other words, you need to define three different rotation transformations.
You may have to define extra classes in ``math``.
Hint: you'll need ``Matrix4x4`` in order to represent 3D transformations.
Make sure to take a look around, some useful functionality might already be implemented.
