= Voronoi Diagram

A Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane constructed as follows:

* Pick a random number of random points stem:[P_i] in the plane.
* To each stem:[P_i] corresponds that part of the plane that is the set
  of all points that are closer to stem:[P_i] than to any other stem:[P].

In the above figure, the red partition corresponds
to the set of all points that are closest to stem:[P_1].
