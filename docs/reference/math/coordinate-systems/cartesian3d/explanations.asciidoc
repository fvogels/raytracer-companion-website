= 3D Cartesian Coordinate System

In a 3D Cartesian coordinate system is defined by its origin point $O$ and three perpendicular axes $X$, $Y$ and $Z$.
The location of each point in 3D space can be expressed using coordinates $(x, y, z)$.

== Left vs Right Handed

We distinguish two kinds of 3D Cartesian coordinate system: left handed and right handed ones.
These differ in the orientation of the Z-axis with respect to the $X$ and $Y$-axis.

The distinction between both becomes apparent when dealing with the <%= link 'reference/math/cross-product', 'cross product' %>.
During this course, we will always use the right handed variant.
