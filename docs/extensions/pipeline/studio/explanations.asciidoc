= Studio Pipeline Segment

In order to make your Chaiscript work with 3D Studio, you need to
have it output the renderings in the correct format:

* First, the images are converted into the WIF file format.
* Next, this byte stream is converted to base64.
* Lastly, this base64 data is written to stdout.

pipeline( scene_animation(scene_at, seconds(5)),
          [ Pipeline.animation(150),
            Pipeline.renderer(renderer),
            Pipeline.wif(),
            Pipeline.base64(),
            Pipeline.stdout() ] )
----

Each of these three steps need to be repeated at the end of your Chaiscript.
It would be more practical if there were a single pipeline segment
that performs all three steps:

pipeline( scene_animation(scene_at, seconds(5)),
          [ Pipeline.animation(150),
            Pipeline.renderer(renderer),
            Pipeline.studio() ] )

[TASK]
====
Create a new pipeline segment so that you can replace the
``Pipeline.wif(), Pipeline.base64(), Pipeline.stdout()``
by a single segment ``Pipeline.studio()``.
