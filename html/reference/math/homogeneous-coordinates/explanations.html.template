        <h1>Homogeneous Coordinates</h1>
        <p>
          Homogenoous coordinates blur the distinction between points and vectors and
          provide a unified mathematical framework. The basic idea is to see vectors
          as being points at infinity. However, if we were to simply
          use $(\infty, \infty, \infty)$ as the coordinates for a vector,
          we would not know in what direction the vector points, nor what its length is.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solution to this problem consists of adding an extra coordinate, often called $w$.
          This means that when working in 2D space, we need three coordinates, while working in 3D
          space requires 4 coordinates. During this explanation, we will work in 2D.
        </p>
        <p>
          A 2D point whose "regular" Cartesian coordinates are $(x, y)$ has homogeneous coordinates $(x, y, 1)$, whereas
          a 2D vector with Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ has homogeneous coordinates $(x, y, 0)$.
          In other words, we can differentiate between points and vectors based on their $w$-value.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what about other values of $w$? The general rule is that if $w \neq 0$, homogeneous
          coordinates $(x, y, w)$ correspond to the Cartesian coordinates $(x / w, y / w)$.
          In case $w = 0$, we would get $(x / 0, y / 0)$, which leads to infinities, hence
          the interpretation that vectors are "points on infinity".
        </p>
        <p>
          From the fact that $(x, y, w) = (x / w, y / w)$ follows that a point has infinitely many homogeneous coordinates.
          The following examples all correspond to the same point $(2, 1)$:
          \[
            (2, 1, 1) \qquad (4, 2, 2) \qquad (-2, -1, -1) \qquad (20, 10, 10)
          \]
          Generally, we will want to keep $w = 0$ for vectors and $w = 1$ for points and not venture
          further in the crazy abstract worlds that homogeneous coordinates produce.
        </p>
        <h1>Operations</h1>
        <p>
          As explained on <%= link 'reference/math/points-and-vectors', 'points and vectors' %>,
          addition and subtraction is only allowed on certain combinations of operands:
          we can add two vectors together, but not two points, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Homogeneous coordinates provide a simple way to remember these rules:
          any combination is allowed, as long as the result's $w$-coordinate is either $0$ or $1$.
          For example,
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Adding a point $(x, y, 1)$ and a vector $(x', y', 0)$ is allowed, since
            the result would be $(x + x', y + y', 1)$. This also tells us that
            adding a point and a vector yields a point, because the result's $w$-coordinate is 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding two points $(x, y, 1)$ and $(x', y', 1)$ is disallowed, as we
            would get $(x + x', y + y', 2)$. While it is technically possible to allow this result
            (addition would correspond to some kind of weird average between points,
            since $(x + x', y + y', 2) = (\frac{x+x'}{2}, \frac{y+y'}{2}, 1)$),
            we will refrain to do so.
