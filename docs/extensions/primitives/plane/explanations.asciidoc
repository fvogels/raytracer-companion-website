== Implementation

Your starter code comes with an implementation for XY-planes.
Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to implement XZ-planes and YZ-planes.

As a first step, we suggest you take a good look at the XY-plane implementation to understand how the ray-plane intersection algorithm works.
Then, implement extra classes using XY-plane as a guide.

[TASK]
====
Implement XZ- and YZ planes.

* Both planes should contain the point stem:[(0, 0, 0)].
  Moving the plane around can be done separately using translations.
* Make these available as `xz_plane()` and `yz_plane()` in the scripting language.
