          <h1>Sanity Checks (06/10/2016)</h1>
          <p>
            Try to write as many assertions as you can. An assertion is written <code>assert(some_condition)</code>
            and is checked only in debug builds. If the condition fails, the application will crash
            with an error message indicating which assertion went wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assertions are a valuable debugging tool. Say you're writing code that should produce a unit length vector <code>v</code>
            that's perpendicular on some other vector <code>u</code>. Before returning this vector <code>v</code>,
            perform the following sanity checks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>assert(v.is_unit());</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>assert(v.is_perpendicular_on(u));</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can see assertions as some kind of inline unit tests: every time the code is executed,
            you perform a quick test to see if the results make sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that assertions should not be used to verify external input: these checks should <em>always</em> be performed at runtime, i.e.
            not just in debug builds but also in release builds. Use assertions only to check "internal" code.

        <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
        <article>
          <h1>Release builds crash at runtime (04/10/2016)</h1>
          <p>
            By default, the compiler is allowed to use advanced instruction sets in order to increase performace.
            Unfortunately, not every CPU supports these, leading to a crash when it encounters such an instruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            To fix this problem, follow these steps:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the solution explorer, right click on the project (<em>not on the solution</em>). Pick properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the left pane, go to Configuration Properties - C/C++. In the right part,
              look for "Enable Enhanced Instruction Set". Put this on Not Set.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h1>Long Release Build Times (04/10/2016)</h1>
          <p>
            Release builds are quite slow due to global optimization: the linker looks at the whole program
            and looks for all kinds of ways to optimize your program. This happens even if you make a small
            change in a single file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turning global optimization off will decrease build times dramatically. However, the produced
            executable will not run as fast. Measurements on my PC show that the change in performance
            is not large: rendering a complex scene went from 2.45 minutes to 2.56 minutes, which is a difference of 6-7 seconds, which
            is only 4%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two new builds have been introduced: "Release - Fast Compile" and "Release - No Scripting - Fast Compile".
            Feel free to use these builds instead of "Release" and "Release - No Scripting".
          </p>

          <h1>Long Rendering Times (04/10/2016)</h1>
          <p>
            If rendering takes too long, try the following things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Make sure you're not running a debug build.
            </li>
            <li>
              Decrease the resolution. Remember: going from 500 &times; 500 to 400 &times; 400 will reduce
              your rendering times by a approximately 40%.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add <%= link 'extensions/performance/parallel-task-scheduler', 'multithreading' %>. Since ray tracing
              is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a>,
              you will, depending on your cpu, be able to get gains ranging for 2 to 8&times; faster.
