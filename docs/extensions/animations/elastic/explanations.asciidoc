== Implementation

The elastic animation looks as follows:

The animation can be parameterized in two ways:

* Number of oscillations

* Energy loss
+

[TASK]
====
Create files `math/functions/easing/elastic-easing-function.cpp/.h`.
Use `linear-easing-function.h/.cpp` as a guide. You'll need to find the formula yourself.

Don't forget to add a binding for the scripting language. In `scripting/math-module`, update the `EasingLibrary` structure and add an extra `BIND` to `add_easing`.
