= Setting Things Up

Follow the steps below carefully.
If you're in trouble and I see you haven't followed these steps, I'll simply refer you back to this page.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that some steps need to be taken by each team member while others should only happen once per team.
====

== Cloning the Repository

Due to GitHub issues, the repo does not come with the starter code.
This combined with the fact that it's a group project slightly complicates the setup process.

[NOTE,caption="each team member"]
====
* Go to the GitHub classroom link (see Toledo).
* Create a new team or pick an existing team.
* Clone the repository `git clone URL`.
* Add the original repo as remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ucll-3dcg/student`
====

[NOTE,caption="once per team"]
====
If the repo is empty, it means you are the first one of your team to perform these steps and the starter code still needs to be added.

* Pull in the starter code: `git pull upstream master`.
* Push it to your repo: `git push`.
====

== GitHub

[NOTE,caption="once per team"]
====
* Go to your repo's website.
* Go to the Projects tab.
* Create a new project.
* Name it 'raytracer' (the name is important).
* As template, use Automated kanban.
====

== Issues

[NOTE,caption="once per team"]
====
Look for a directory named `github` in your repo's root.
There should be a script named `create-issues.sh`.
Running it will create an issue for each extension on GitHub.
====

== Setting Up Visual Studio

[NOTE,caption="each team member"]
====
* Open the solution file `raytrace/raytracer.sln`.
* In the Solution Explorer, click on "Show All Files".
  Instead of only seeing "Header files", "Resource files" and "Source files" you should get a long list of folders.
* In the toolbar, pick `Release` build.
* Build the project (kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+B]).
  This creates an executable file `raytracer.exe`.
  Locate it; it should be somewhere under a `raytracer\raytracer\x64\Release` directory.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not dare open the project as a folder in Visual Studio.
====

== WIF Viewer

The project (a ray tracer) you will develop during this course outputs graphical data (images and movies.)
We _could_ output this data as PNG, JPG, MP4, &hellip; but in order to keep things simple, we will use a custom file format named WIF.
Since regular graphics software will not be able to open WIF files, we provide you with two options: a WPF-based viewer and a Python one.

=== WPF-Based WIF Viewer

This viewer will only work on Windows.

[NOTE,caption="each team member"]
====
* Clone https://github.com/ucll-3dcg/wif.net[this repository].
* Open the solution.
* Open `Configuration.cs`.
* Change `RAYTRACER_PATH` so that it refers to the `raytracer.exe` file you just build.
* Change to Release build.
* Build (kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+B]).
* Run (kbd:[Ctrl+F5]).
* Optional but recommended: pin the application to the task bar so that you can easily launch it.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some students think they that, in order to run this viewer, they need to open Visual Studio and launch it from there.
Please stop this foolishness: compiling C# produces an `.exe` file, so you can simply launch that.
Feel free to copy this file to your desktop, or create a shortcut to it (better), or simply pin it to your taskbar (best).
====

=== Python WIF Viewer

This viewer should work on all platforms, but it's still very much untested.

[NOTE,caption="each team member"]
====
* Run `pip install git+https://github.com/ucll-3dcg/wif.git`
