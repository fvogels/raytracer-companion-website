Consider the wavy strip we created using triangles:

In order to make it appear smoother, we could increase the number of triangles:

image::nonsmooth-strip-many.png[align="center",width="50%"]

Here, we doubled the amount of triangles, doubling the rendering time.
Also, as you can see, the shading is not perfectly smooth: there are jumps between the different shades of red.
In this extension, we examine a cheaper way to make things look smoother without adding triangles.
