Shapes can be constructed by combining simpler shapes in different ways:

[cols="^.^,^.^"]
|===
| Union | image:union.png[align="center"]
| Difference | image:difference.png[align="center"]
| Intersection | image:intersection.png[align="center"]
|===

The code for union is already given.
Use it as a template to define the two other operations.
Note however that while the union operation is defined as taking a list of children,
intersection and difference can limit themselves to exactly two children.

== Intersection

[TASK]
====
* Create files `primitives/intersection-primitive.cpp` and `primitives/intersection-primitive.h`.
* Write the necessary code.
* Provide a factory function with signature `Primitive intersection(Primitive, Primitive)`.
* Expose this operation as `intersection` to the scripting language.
====

== Difference

[TASK]
====
* Create files `primitives/difference-primitive.cpp` and `primitives/difference-primitive.h`.
* Write the necessary code.
* Provide a factory function with signature `Primitive difference(Primitive, Primitive)`.
* Expose this operation as `intersection` to the scripting language.
