= Logic Operations

[overview]
----
difficulty 2
requires patterns/basics
----

Patterns are functions that associate a boolean value (typically interpreted as black and white) with every point.

[source,language='c++']
----
bool pattern_function(const Point2D& point) // 2D
bool pattern_function(const Point3D& point) // 3D
----

We also know there exist operations on boolean values:

* Conjunction `b1 && b2`.
* Disjunction `b1 || b2`.
* Negation `!b`.

In this extension, we find out what happens if we apply those logic operators on patterns.

[EXAMPLE]
====
Say we have two patterns `p1` and `p2`.

[options="header",cols="^,^"]
|===
| p1 | p2
a| image::hlines.png[width="25%"]
a| image::vlines.png[width="25%"]
|===

If we combine them using disjunction, we get

image::combined.png[align="center",width="25%"]

Notice how in the resulting image, a pixel is white if either one of the images above has a white pixel in the same spot.

== Implementation

[TASK]
====
Create files `patterns/pattern-logic-operations.cpp` and `patterns/pattern-logic-operations.h`.
====

=== 2D

Pattern2D conjunction(Pattern2D pattern1, Pattern2D pattern2);
Pattern2D disjunction(Pattern2D pattern1, Pattern2D pattern2);
Pattern2D exclusive_disjunction(Pattern2D pattern1, Pattern2D pattern2);
Pattern2D negation(Pattern2D pattern);

=== 3D

Pattern3D conjunction(Pattern3D pattern1, Pattern3D pattern2);
Pattern3D disjunction(Pattern3D pattern1, Pattern3D pattern2);
Pattern3D exclusive_disjunction(Pattern3D pattern1, Pattern3D pattern2);
Pattern3D negation(Pattern3D pattern);
