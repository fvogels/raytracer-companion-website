== Implementation

Start with the reading material mentioned in the overview above.

The parameters for a fisheye camera are

* Its eye.
* Its look_at point.
* Its up vector.
* Its horizontal angle, type ``Angle``.
* Its vertical angle, type ``Angle``.

[TASK]
====
Create the files ``cameras/fisheye-camera.cpp`` and ``cameras/fisheye-camera.h``.
We suggest you copy paste the code from perspective cameras to these files and modify them as necessary.

Following things might prove useful for implementing fisheye cameras are

* ``math::Interval`` and ``math::IntervalMapper`` to translate stem:[[0, 1]] to stem:[[\alpha, \beta]].
* ``Point3D::spherical`` to create a point given spherical coordinates.
