= N-Rooks Sampler

== Definition

An n-rooks sampler takes a single parameter $N$. It subdivides the given rectangle in $N \times N$ subrectangles.
It then picks $N$ random subrectangles so that in exactly one subrectangle is picked in each row and
exactly one subrectangle is picked in each column. The name comes from the fact that if you view the subdivided
rectangle as a chess board and rooks are placed on the selected subrectangles, that none
of the rooks can capture any of the other rooks.

From each selected subrectangle, a random point is returned.
