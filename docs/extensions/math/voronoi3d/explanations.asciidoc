== Explanation

[TASK]
====
Implement a class ``Voronoi3D`` that provides the following functionality.

* The constructor should receive a seed (or something functionally equivalent) making it possible to generate the exact same Voronoi diagram deterministically.
* A member function ``closest_to``, that, given a ``Point3D``, returns the ``Point3D`` closest to it.

The class should not restrict itself to a particular part of the 3D space.
Instead, it should fill the entire "universe" with an infinite number of points, thereby creating an infinitely large Voronoi diagram.
