== Implementation

[TASK]
====
Create files `math/functions/easing/quadratic-function.cpp/.h` and implement `quadratic_in`, `quadratic_out` and `quadratic_inout` as described in <</reference/animations/quadratic/explanations#,here>>.
Use `linear-easing-function.h/.cpp` as a guide.

Don't forget to add a binding for the scripting language. In `scripting/math-module`, update the `EasingLibrary` structure and add an extra `BIND` to `add_easing`.
====

[TASK]
====
Do the same for the <</reference/animations/cubic/explanations#,cubic easing function>>.
Put the implementation in separate files `math/functions/easing/cubic-function.cpp/.h`.
====

[TASK]
====
Do the same for the <</reference/animations/quintic/explanations#,quintic easing function>>.
Put the implementation in separate files `math/functions/easing/quintic-function.cpp/.h`.
