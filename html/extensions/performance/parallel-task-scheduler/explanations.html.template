          <h2>Tasks</h2>
          <p>
            In order to facilitate the implementation of a multithreaded ray tracer, we introduced
            the concept of <em>tasks</em>. A task is an independent unit of work. Two tasks
            should be able to be performed in any order without it affecting the results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tasks are modelled by the ``Task`` class, declared in ``tasks/tasks.h``.
            This class defines a single method ``perform``.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Task Schedulers</h2>
          <p>
            A <em>task scheduler</em> takes a list of tasks and performs each of them.
            No guarantees are made about the order in which it performs them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Task schedulers are modelled by the ``TaskSchedulerImplementation``
            (and <%= link 'reference/design/wrappers', 'wrapped' %> by ``TaskScheduler``s.
            They only provide one method: ``perform``, which takes a list of tasks.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Serial Task Scheduler</h2>
          <p>
            You were given ``SerialTaskScheduler``, a task scheduler
            that performs the tasks in sequential order. Take a look at the code
            in ``tasks/serial-task-scheduler.cpp``: you'll see that
            it is nothing but a loop.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Parallel Task Scheduler</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of this extension is to implement ``ParallelTaskScheduler``.
            Its ``perform`` method should create multiple threads and
            divide the tasks among them.
          </p>
          <aside class="boxed2">
            <h1>Task</h1>
            <p>
              Implement ``ParallelTaskScheduler``. It needs to give the following guarantees:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                All given tasks must be performed exactly once.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the scheduler's ``perform`` method returns, all tasks have to be performed.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Since the tasks are independent, you do not need to perform any synchronization on their behalf.
              A class that might come in handy is <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic">atomic</a>,
              but many other approaches are possible too.
