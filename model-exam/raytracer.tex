\begin{Exercise}
Give the SDL file that produces this result:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=6cm]{scene.png}
\end{center}
The camera is located at $(0,0,10)$, looks at $(0,0,0)$ and has up-vector $(0,1,0)$.
The sphere in the middle has radius 1; the lower sphere is twice as big.
Make sure not to forget about the following details:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The lights
  \item The material's properties (these do not have to be 100\% correct)
  \item The exact transformations.
\end{itemize}
\begin{solution}
\lstinputlisting[language={}]{scene.sdl}
\end{solution}

\begin{Exercise}
Give the SDL file that produces this result:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{scene2.png}
\end{center}
The camera is located at $(0,0,10)$, looks at $(0,0,0)$ and has up-vector $(0,1,0)$.
Both spheres have radius 1.
Make sure not to forget about the following details:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The lights
  \item The material's properties (these do not have to be 100\% correct)
  \item The exact transformations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{Exercise}
Give the SDL file that produces this result:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{scene3.png}
\end{center}
The camera is located at $(0,0,10)$, looks at $(0,0,0)$ and has up-vector $(0,1,0)$.
Both spheres have radius 1.
Make sure not to forget about the following details:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The lights
  \item The material's properties (these do not have to be 100\% correct)
  \item The exact transformations.

\begin{Exercise}
Give the SDL file that produces this result:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{scene4.png}
\end{center}
The camera is located at $(0,0,10)$, looks at $(0,0,0)$ and has up-vector $(0,1,0)$.
The sphere has radius 1 and is white. A large square is placed behind this sphere.
Make sure not to forget about the following details:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The lights
  \item The material's properties (these do not have to be 100\% correct)
  \item The exact transformations.
\end{itemize}
\begin{solution}
\lstinputlisting[language={}]{scene4.sdl}
